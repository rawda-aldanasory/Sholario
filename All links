All MCIT Scholarships 
Project Overview:
The project aims to centralize information by gathering all MCIT scholarships and training programs into a single platform, providing easy access for students to find relevant opportunities based on their field of study and eligibility. It also supports educators by allowing them to apply for training positions within MCIT programs.
